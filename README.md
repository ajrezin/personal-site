# Welcome!

This is my personal website that I started building in 2020 to further my understanding of accessible web development. Its's built from scratch using Gatsby and is a constant work in progress. If you have any suggestions for improvement, I'm happy to hear them!

## ðŸ“™ Todo

1. ~~Fix the height issue on mobile devices where the vh is smaller than computed and content is hidden behind the navbar~~
1. Make the embedded pdf of my resume accessible to screen reader users
1. List some of the intentional choices I've made to improve site accessibility on my accessibility page
   - Atkinson Hyperlegible
   - Accessible color palettes
   - Focus indicators w/ focus-visible pseudo class
1. Add an easily-accessible way to contact me (like a form or smth)
1. Figure out if/how to add skip links back in
1. Create a way to automatically display and filter cool sites/resources on the resources page
1. Make sure the default font size is 16px, 18px, or 20px
1. Keep line lengths around 70 characters at most by setting `max-width: 70ch;` in the css
1. Add [AAC Shim](https://tools.openaac.org) to this site to improve the experience for users of AAC
1. ~~Give the mobile and web navbars the <nav> tag or otherwise specify that they are nav elements to make them more accessible~~
1. Make sure all images/logos are svg elements and not font glyphs, which are very inaccessible
1. Redo landing page with a photo of ME !
1. Add animation for navbar links
1. Add an option to switch the site to the dyslexia-friendly font
1. Upgrade npm packages/dependencies

## ðŸª² Known Bugs

1. flash of light when loading page
   - especially noticeable on dark mode

## ðŸš€ Gatsby Quick start

1.  **Start developing with Gatsby.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
