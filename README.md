# Welcome!

This is my personal website that I started building in 2020 to further my understanding of accessible web development. Its's built from scratch using Gatsby and is a constant work in progress. If you have any suggestions for improvement, I'm happy to hear them!

## ðŸ“™ Todo

1. Make sure the navbar never requires scrolling to view
1. List some of the intentional choices I've made to improve site accessibility on my accessibility page
  1. Atkinson Hyperlegible
  1. Skip-links
1. Add animation for navbar links
1. Create a way to automatically display and filter cool sites/resources
1. Add an option to switch the site to the dyslexia-friendly font
1. Add an easily-accessible way to contact me
1. Redo landing page with a photo of ME !

## ðŸª² Known Bugs

1. flash of light when loading page
   - especially noticeable on dark mode
   - common issue, should be an easy fix

## ðŸš€ Gatsby Quick start

1.  **Start developing with Gatsby.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
